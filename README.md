#### Running printCheque.sh
printCheque.sh [-h] -f profileFile -o outputFile -p Payee -a amount -w Words -d date

        -h : Display this help message
        -f : Profile file
        -o : Output ps file
        -s : Print a sample profile file
        -p : Payee Name
        -a : Amount in figures
        -w : Amount in words
        -d : Date in dd-mm-yyyy format
	
#### The Profile File

The layout of the cheque is read from the sample file. A sample profile can be generated by passing -s option to the script.

The x & y coordinates need to be specified for various elements in the cheque. The PostScript system uses a coordinate system whose origin is on the lower left corner. One inch translates to 72 units. This would mean that the x & y measurements in inches need to be multiplied by 72 to get the coordinates.

Once the PostScript file is generated, ps2pdf utility can be used to convert it to pdf file.

```
ps2pdf output.ps

```
To print the pdf file on the cheque leaf, use lpr and change the custom paper size as appropriate.
```
lpr -o PageSize=Custom.9x20cm out.pdf
```
